# Hangman Game 04-03-24
A simple game of hangman that can be played in terminal made in C++. <br>
This game was meant to accomplish a few different things:
<li> Show the letters that are still available and accurately depict the letters in the word which have been guessed. </li> <br>
<li> Allow the user to keep guessing different words after they get one right/wrong. </li> <br>
Although this started out as a standard assignment for class I got emotionally invested in it after spending 20 minutes trying to find out why it wasn't working and realizing I'd used a an '==' instead of an '='. <br>
This was the first project my class did that made us choose when and how to use functions. <br>
What I learned: <br> <br>
<li> How to use and manipulate<strong> arrays</strong> and fill them using loops.</li> <br>
<li> How to use multiple files for one project and then compile that to run it. </li> <br>
<li> Where and when to use <strong>functions</strong> as well as how to pass by reference when using a variable that isn't an array (passed by reference automatically). </li> <br>
For the most part, aside from minor issues the process went smoothly. But there was one large thing I learned for future projects. <br>
Notes for future projects: <br> <br>
<li> When doing projects that are meant to perform multiple tasks: </li> <br>
<ol><li> Plan ahead each task it's supposed to accomplish.</li> <br>
<li> For each of those tasks figure out what variables are needed and what needs to be returned. </li> </ol> <br>
For the future I just need to plan ahead, and focus on everything I want to accomplish specifically before diving straight in. A lesson as old as time.
